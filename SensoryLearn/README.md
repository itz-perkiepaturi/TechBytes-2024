## Overview
Access to education is not universal, with 650+ children still out of school or lacking one-to-one learning opportunities. Sensory Learn addresses this issue as an inclusive online educational platform, committed to providing quality education for all. Aligned with the United Nations Sustainability Goals No. 4: Quality Education and Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities, Sensory Learn focuses on underprivileged children who lack access to traditional education.
